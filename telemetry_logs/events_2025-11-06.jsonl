It\u2019s like a magic recipe that turns sunlight into energy!\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Sunlight**: Plants take in sunlight using a special part of their leaves called chlorophyll, which is what gives leaves their green color.\n\n2. **Water**: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots.\n\n3. **Carbon Dioxide**: Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata.\n\n4. **Making Food**: When the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide come together, the plant uses them to create glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose is the plant's food, and the oxygen is released into the air for us to breathe!\n\nSo, in simple terms, photosynthesis is how plants turn sunlight into food and help keep our air clean.
